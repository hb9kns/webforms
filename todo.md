# ToDo list for development

- page columns with select fields populated from external file, e.g:
  field `[name](name.txt)` would offer entries of file "name.txt" as
  select (pulldown) field when editing

- page columns after index field displaying (and permitting sorting by)
  fields from index file after index name, e.g: config file entry
  `indfields<TAB>2<TAB>3` would append index fields 2 and 3 after index
  in page view
